  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Project` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `key` on the `Project` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `name` on the `Project` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `Project` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `ProjectMember` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `joinedAt` on the `ProjectMember` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `role` on the `ProjectMember` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `ProjectMember` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `firstName` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `lastName` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `role` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Added the required column `ownerId` to the `Project` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `title` to the `Project` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `ProjectMember` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `projectId` on the `ProjectMember` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
